      <p className="about-text">I'm Benjamin, an energetic web developer with over 5 years experience in Ruby on Rails and React.  I come from a background in mathematics, education, and probability.</p>
      <br/>
      <p className="about-text">I love coding, so I have a lot of personal projects (see below).  I turn every project and assignment into an opportunity to learn.  I am a big fan of playing around with different libraries to learn the ins and outs of them.  I enjoy writing tests, building interfaces, and everything about favicons.</p>
      <br/>
      <p className="about-text">Outside of software, I love swimming in the summer and skiing in the winter.  Beach bonfires, dinner parties, and jacuzzis are my favorite things about existing.</p>
